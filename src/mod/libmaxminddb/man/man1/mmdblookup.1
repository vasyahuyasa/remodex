mmdblookup \- a utility to look up an IP address in a MaxMind DB file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
mmdblookup \[en]file [FILE PATH] \[en]ip [IP ADDRESS] [DATA PATH]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]mmdblookup\f[R] looks up an IP address in the specified MaxMind DB
file.
The record for the IP address is displayed in a JSON\-like structure
with type annotations.
.PP
If an IP\[cq]s data entry resolves to a map or array, you can provide a
lookup path to only show part of that data.
.PP
For example, given a JSON structure like this:
.IP "" 4
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]names\[dq]: {
        \[dq]en\[dq]: \[dq]Germany\[dq],
        \[dq]de\[dq]: \[dq]Deutschland\[dq]
    },
    \[dq]cities\[dq]: [ \[dq]Berlin\[dq], \[dq]Frankfurt\[dq] ]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You could look up just the English name by calling mmdblookup with a
lookup path of:
.IP "" 4
.nf
\f[C]
mmdblookup \-\-file ... \-\-ip ... names en
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Or you could look up the second city in the list with:
.IP "" 4
.nf
\f[C]
mmdblookup \-\-file ... \-\-ip ... cities 1
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Array numbering begins with zero (0).
.PP
If you do not provide a path to lookup, all of the information for a
given IP will be shown.
